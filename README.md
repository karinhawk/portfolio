## About <a name = "about"></a>

My website portfolio built with NextJS and Firebase. Here is where I introduce myself, my tech stack, and a sample of some of my projects. The projects page pulls from a database I created with firebase. This was my first time using NextJS and implementing firebase. I experimented using global scss and module scss, and with keyframe animations. Also my first time using env variables for security.
